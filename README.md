# wem2ogg
A simple wem to ogg converter.

## How to use:
- Download latest release and place it somewhere (ex. `C:\Users\USER\Documents\wem2ogg`) 
- Move your .wem files into the directory you placed wem2ogg in 
- Run `convert.bat`

None of the programs/code were made by me; the aim of this repository was to make a simple wem to ogg converter using the programs and code credited at the bottom. <br>
